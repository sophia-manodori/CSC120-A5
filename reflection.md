- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
It was not as hard as the other coding assignments. I feel it was just a lot of learning how to specifically reference certain things, but not so much learning new coding language and whatnot. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think taking things step by step and not trying to rush through is always the way to go. I got a little tripped up when I was working with the new fuel type attribute, but it turned out to not so bad.
